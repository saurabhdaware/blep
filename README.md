# Blep Language üê∂

A simple programming language where you define variables with `boop` keyword and print them with `bark` keyword. Compiler built in JavaScript.

```
boop a = 3;
boop b = 9;
bark(a + b);
```

## How to use

The compiler is built over JavaScript so it requires Node.js installed.

### Install Compiler

npm install -g blep
```

### Run Blep Code

Create `hello.blep` file with following content
```js
boop a = 3;
boop b = 9;
bark(a + b);
```

**Execute the code with**
```
blep hello.blep
```

Output
```
12
```

## Local Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/saurabhdaware/blep.git
cd blep/
yarn
yarn link # this register blep command in your terminal

blep examples/hello-world.blep
```

You can try changing the code in `src/index.js`
